There are 22 features in this synthetic dataset and 10 possible class labels.
The dataset has 850 number of samples. To create the dataset, I
first trained a feedforward neural network on a portion of the CTG dataset,
and then I generated the ground labels by channeling the holdout data through
the trained NN.

The NN has two hidden layers of Sigmoid activation functions, where each hidden 
layer has 20 nodes. The class distributions are as follows:

0. 33.76 percent are from class 0
1. 37.88 percent are from class 1
2. 0.0 percent are from class 2
3. 0.0 percent are from class 3
4. 0.0 percent are from class 4
5. 28.35 percent are from class 5
6. 0.0 percent are from class 6
7. 0.0 percent are from class 7
8. 0.0 percent are from class 8
9. 0.0 percent are from class 9
